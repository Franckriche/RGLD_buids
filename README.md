Videogame for Rational Game and Level Design in Algebra University

* WASD to move.
* Left mouse button to attack.
* Right mouse button to parry.
* If well timed (early), parry can counter make special effects.
In order to make the perfect parry you have to hold the parry button less than 2 seconds.
* One button to increase the attack of the player between each waves.
* One button to heal the player.
You have to make a choice between healing or increasing attack.
* One button to skip the wave to test difficulty after each wave ( I think there is some adjustment to make on the difficulty)
